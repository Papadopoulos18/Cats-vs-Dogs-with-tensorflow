# Cats-vs-Dogs-with-tensorflow

I am creating a deep leanrning structure to train, test and validate a large dataset of images of cats and dogs with Tensorflow.

First we run the "#2 load in our own data.ipynb" and we take the stored data as X.pickle and y.pickle. I have only uploaded the y.pickle file, because X.pickle in above 25mb, but you can generate X.pickle by excecuting this code.
Then we can implement the CNN in the previous structure by running the "#3 put the CNN in our #2 structure".
After, we try to see our model graphically with Tensorboard so we run #4. But we come to see that our model overfits.
So we try to optimize our model by running #5.
