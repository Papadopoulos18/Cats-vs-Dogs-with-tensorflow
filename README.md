# Cats-vs-Dogs-with-tensorflow

I am creating a deep leanrning structure to train, test and validate a large dataset of images of cats and dogs with Tensorflow.

First we run the "#2 load in our own data.ipynb" and we take the stored data as X.pickle and y.pickle which i have given as a X,y.pickle.zip File.
Then we can implement the CNN in the previous structure by running the "#3 put the CNN in our #2 structure".
